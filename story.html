                        What is the one philosophy that drives <a href="#SCAAL">SCAAL?</a> We believe that no matter where you go, you should
                        always be able to enjoy the simple pleasure of a good cup of coffee in a comfortable
                        environment. At home, reading the morning paper. At your local SCAAL, conversing with a
                        confidant. Or perhaps in some foreign land, SCAAL will be greeting you like an old friend. After
                        all, coffee is a ritual that transcends all cultural boundaries. It makes us feel alert,
                        energetic and alive.</p>
                    <a href="" style="text-decoration: none;"><span class="paragraph-title">Where we began</span></a>
                    <p> Anders Carlson lived a sheltered life in a small fishing village in Marstrand, Sweden. As a
                        child, he listened to stories of his grandfather Oluf’s adventures and expeditions. Often his
                        grandfather would bring back exotic coffees for the family to enjoy. </p>
                    <p>Upon his graduation Anders left home to see the world. He worked all kinds of odd jobs. He worked
                        in Parisian cafes and Italian espresso bars. He worked in the coffee fields of Brazil and New
                        Guinea. And in a few years, Anders learned the art of selecting the perfect coffee bean and
                        roasting it to perfection. </p>
                    <p>He returned home in 1980 to open the first SCAAL in Stockholm, Sweden. By creating his own unique
                        blends of coffee and a stimulating atmosphere, SCAAL quickly became the place to gather – day or
                        night – not only in Stockholm, Sweden, but 670 cities around the world. </p>
                    <p><span class="paragraph-title" id="SCAAL">What makes SCAAL the best coffee?</span></p>
                    <p> Anders has passed down the knowledge he learned as an apprentice in the coffee fields to every
                        buyer, roaster, and franchise owner. SCAAL's standards for coffee are never compromised. We only
                        select SHB – strictly hard bean or strictly high grown – coffee beans. To ensure their flavorful
                        oils are preserved, extraordinary steps are taken to protect the coffee bean from heat, light,
                        air and moisture. </p>
                    <p>All these efforts are made so that we may offer you a perfect cup of coffee.</p>
                    <p>There are so many places you could go to buy coffee. We've gone to extraordinary efforts to
                        ensure that SCAAL is your best choice. The quality begins at harvest. SCAAL relies on selective
                        picking, a labor-intensive process that involves making several passes among the trees for those
                        cherries that are perfectly ripe. Then we select top grade SHB, which stands for strictly hard
                        bean or strictly high grown. Beans that are grown at a minimum altitude of 4,000 feet above sea
                        level for optimum flavor. Within hours of shipping our coffee to you, the beans are roasted
                        on-site in small batches by a Certified Roastmaster and vacuum-packed to retain its fresh taste
                        and rich aroma.</p>
